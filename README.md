ArtemisJoystickControl
======================

Use a joystick to control Artemis SBS.
I've used a Leo Bodnar Joystick with this code. 
It detects your screen resolution and picks the right coordinates, for now it supports 1366x768 and 1280x800

Update: Found my old script for Engineering aswell. A better version of it lives here https://github.com/NiKiZe/ArtemisSBS
